  update_batch_size: 16 # Number of vectorised gradient updates per device.
  total_num_envs: 512  # Total Number of vectorised environments across all devices and batched_updates. Needs to be divisible by n_devices*update_batch_size.

system:
  total_buffer_size: 8192 # Total effective size of the replay buffer across all devices and vectorised update steps. This means each device has a buffer of size buffer_size//num_devices which is further divided by the update_batch_size. This value must be divisible by num_devices*update_batch_size.
  total_batch_size: 512 # Total effective number of samples to train on. This means each device has a batch size of batch_size/num_devices which is further divided by the update_batch_size. This value must be divisible by num_devices*update_batch_size.
